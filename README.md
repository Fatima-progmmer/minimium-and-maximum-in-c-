# minimium-and-maximum-in-c-
The code is designed to find the maximum and minimum salary from a set of ten inputs. Then, inside the loop, max should be updated if a higher salary is found, and min should be updated if a lower salary is found. The final output statements should also be corrected to reflect the proper variables.
